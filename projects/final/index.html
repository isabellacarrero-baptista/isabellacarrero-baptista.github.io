        <h1>Crash course on Maryland car crashes</h1>
        <h2>Impaired driving causes high number of deaths</h2>

        <div class="container text">
            <p>The total 172 car crash deaths in Maryland this year grew by two this morning, when a <a
                    href="https://www.wmar2news.com/local/two-people-dead-after-car-overturns-on-interstate-in-frederick-county">Toyota
                    RAV4 overturned</a> at the ramp from Maryland Route 80 to northbound Interstate-270. The driver and
                passenger died at the scene.</p>
            <p>Since 2016, the Maryland Highway Safety Office reports that about a total of <a
                    href="https://zerodeathsmd.gov/resources/crashdata/crashdashboard/">4,300</a> drivers have died at
                the wheel of a car. Yet at a glance, Maryland still remains safe compared to national data.</p>
            <p>Forbes ranked Maryland ninth in the <a
                    href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/most-dangerous-states-for-drivers/">Top 10 Safest States
                    for Drivers</a>, accounting for fatal car accidents per capita, total people killed in car accidents
                per capita and reasons for the crash. Overall, the state ranked 43rd.</p>

                <div class="col-md-3">
                    <p>However, a high percentage of those fatalities were from drivers under the influence of alcohol
                        and/or drugs. Impaired driving comprised 75 percent of the total deaths, ranking 13th among the
                        other states. Wicomico County had the greatest percentage of impairment fatalities, making up 31
                        percent of its total 93 deaths since 2016.

            <p>Montgomery County — which was tied at fifth with Prince George’s County, Charles County and Cecil County
                — has placed an extra emphasis on reducing impaired driving through Maryland’s Vision Zero law.</p>
            <p>The bill passed in 2019 with the goal of reducing motor vehicle-related deaths or serious injuries by
                2030, according to the <a
                    href="https://zerodeathsmd.gov/highway-safety-office/strategic-highway-safety-plan/">MHSO</a>. <a
                    href="https://www.rockvillemd.gov/2312/Vision-Zero">Sweden</a> first introduced this initiative in
                1997 amid countrywide rising traffic fatalities and serious injuries.

                    <p>Maryland’s Strategic Highway Safety Plan targets six major causes of motor vehicle crashes and
                        fatalities, called “Emphasis Areas”: distracted driving, impaired driving, infrastructure,
                        occupant protection, pedestrians and bicyclists, speed and aggressive driving.

            <p>“Under the Zero Deaths Maryland umbrella, these agencies use a data-driven and interdisciplinary strategy
                that applies education, enforcement, engineering, and emergency medical services to prevent fatal and
                severe crashes,” states the 2021-2025 SHSP.</p>
            <p>Montgomery County supplemented the initiative with its <a
                    href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/visionzero/Resources/Files/Ending_Impaired_Driving_Deaths_Strategy_2023.pdf">Ending
                    Impaired Crash Fatalities Action Plan</a>. According to the plan, impaired driving deaths account
                for nearly one-third of all traffic deaths in the county. A contributing factor to the issue is the <a

                    of marijuana</a> in the state, which was allowed to be legally be used for recreational purposes in
                July, 2023. A <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/bibliography/ref/2229">study</a> in the Journal of
                Studies on Alcohol and Drugs estimated the legalization would cause a 6.5 percent increase in car crash
                injury rates and a 2.3 percent increase in fatal crash rates.

            <p>Young people are most at risk of impaired driving. Almost three in 10 drivers with blood alcohol
                concentration levels of .08%, the legal limit, were between the ages of 25 and 34 years old in 2016. The
                plan also reported that the second largest group were ages 21 to 24, which made up 26 percent.
            </p>
            <p>There have been other local efforts to reduce the risk of youth driving under the influence, such as Safe
                and Sane. This event, usually run by high schools’ Parent Teacher Student Association, is a sober
                all-night celebration after graduation.
            </p>
            <p>“Parents can go home knowing their senior is in a safe and fun environment without the risks associated
                with the statistically deadliest night for young adults,” said the <a

                    Committee</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Despite these efforts, the total state fatalities have recently increased. There was an eight percent
                increase from 2022 to 2023, the biggest jump since 2016, when the MHSO started collecting traffic data.
            </p>
            <p>“The number of serious and fatal injuries remains higher than we can accept,” said Montgomery County
                Executive Marc Elrich. “Vision Zero is an audacious goal. It is one that we can all embrace and champion
                together.”
